# OOD Mind Map

This is a proof-of-concept application to consume a CSV (of a prescribed structure, and currently in flux) to show illustrate collaborations.

### 🚧 Development

You'll need Node v16.13.1. If you don't have that version installed, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Setup with `nvm use 14.16.0`. Run development server on port `8080` with `npm start`.

### 🎁 Production

Build the application for production with `npm run build`. The `dist` directory will contain the bundled files.
